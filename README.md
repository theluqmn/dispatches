# DISPATCHES

My personal dispatch - its a blog but cooler.

## About

I want to share things for the internet to read and take notes from, so I will need a blog-like website deployed online - that is [Dispatches](https://dispatches.theluqmn.com). It fulfills the said objective, using Jekyll - that I customised to fit my overall theme. It is the successor to my [blog](https://blog.theluqmn.com).
