On 23rd July 2025 (yesterday), I had the opportunity to teach my juniors at school how to make a simple website using HTML. It was an activity organised by the school's computer club, which i am a part of. The objective was to introduce them to web development and spark their interest in coding.

## THE WORKSHOP

I got to teach a group of about 20-25 students, who is part of the computer club. Most of them have **minimal experience with coding**.

## HOW IT WENT

The teacher in charge of the computer club gave everyone a brief introduction to HTML and CSS. afterwards, everyone grouped in partners, was given a laptop, and I took over and guided them through creating a simple HTML webpage. we started by ensuring everyone is familiar with notepad, then we moved on to understanding some basic file operations like saving files with the `.html` extension. then, I gave them step-by-step instructions on how to create a basic webpage. We covered the following topics:

- -> HTML structure: doctype, html, head, body tags.
- -> Headings and paragraphs: using `<h1>` to `<h6>` for headings and `<p>` for paragraphs.
- -> Images: using the `<img>` tag to add images.

Once they understood the basics, I encouraged them to experiment with what they learned.

## THE OUTCOME

My juniors were quite excited! They applied what they learned and created their own simple webpages. The teacher in charge then asked them to create a webpage about them introducing themselves to submit as an assignment. It was great to see them so engaged and eager to learn more.

I was impressed by their enthusiasm and creativity. Some of them even started exploring more advanced topics like CSS styling and some other HTML elements like buttons and links. it was a rewarding experience to see them grasp the concepts and apply them in real-time.

## CONCLUSION

Overall, the workshop was a success. It was tiring, as the teachers gave me full control of the workshop, but it was worth it. I hope this experience will inspire them to continue learning about web development and coding in general.

always take opportunities to share knowledge and help others learn!
